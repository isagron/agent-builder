Procedure: Investigating External Server Connectivity Issues

Step 1: Verify Basic Network Connectivity
	1.	Check if the computer is connected to the network (Wi-Fi/Ethernet).
	•	Windows: look at the network icon in the taskbar.
	•	Linux/macOS: run ifconfig or ip addr and check for a valid IP address.
	2.	Test internet connectivity:
	•	Run ping 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS).
	•	If it fails, there is a local network or ISP problem.

Step 2: Verify DNS Resolution
	1.	Run nslookup <server_name> or dig <server_name>.
	•	If DNS fails, try pinging the server’s IP directly.
	•	If IP works but DNS does not, the issue is with DNS configuration.
	•	Check /etc/resolv.conf (Linux/macOS) or DNS settings in Windows.

⸻

Step 3: Test Server Reachability
	1.	Run ping <server_ip>.
	•	If it works, the server is reachable.
	•	If it fails, ICMP may be blocked or the server is down.
	2.	Run traceroute <server_ip> (Linux/macOS) or tracert <server_ip> (Windows).
	•	This helps identify where the traffic is being blocked (local router, ISP, or further).

⸻

Step 4: Check Firewall and Security Rules
	1.	Verify if local firewall rules block outgoing traffic:
	•	Linux: sudo iptables -L -n or sudo ufw status.
	•	Windows: check Windows Defender Firewall settings.
	2.	If using a corporate or cloud network, check security groups, proxy, or VPN restrictions.

⸻

Step 5: Test Application-Level Connectivity
	1.	If connecting on a specific port (e.g., SSH on port 22, HTTP on 80, HTTPS on 443):
	•	Run telnet <server_ip> <port> or nc -vz <server_ip> <port>.
	•	If the port is closed or filtered, the connection will fail.
	2.	If the service requires credentials or tokens, verify they are valid.

⸻

Step 6: Check Server Status
	1.	Confirm the external server is online and not under maintenance.
	2.	If you can reach the server from another machine or network, the issue is local.
	3.	If the server is unreachable globally, the issue is with the server itself.

⸻

Step 7: Escalation / Resolution
	•	If all network checks are correct but connection still fails:
	•	Gather logs (/var/log/syslog, application logs).
	•	Document IP, port, traceroute, and error messages.
	•	Escalate to the network administrator or server owner.
